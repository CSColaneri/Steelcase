Unzip steelcase_turnin.zip in a clean directory. 

>SOURCE CODE

You'll find our source code in Steelcase_source. We've had many issues with Eclipse and do not recommend it.

>>VSCODE

If you open Steelcase_source in vscode, you must run the gui configuration. On the menu of icons on the left,
select the debug icon (Play button with bug). On the new menu, at the top there is a drop down menu; select gui.
Then run it.

>>INTELLIJ

Import the Steelcase_source project into a new Intellij java project (if prompted for a java version, use java 12) When it's 
finished loading, create a new application run configuration. GuiMain is the main class (it may take a while for intellij to 
find it), and make sure to include the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=ambient-scope-342219-3894e6e0fc09.json
Now you can run the program.

>>FROM A DIFFERENT IDE

If you open a java project with the source code and want to run it from there, you'll have to make sure the environment variable
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS is set to the path to ambient-scope-342219-3894e6e0fc09.json. Without this, the program will be
unable to find the credentials necessary to connect to the database.
